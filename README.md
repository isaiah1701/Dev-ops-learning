# DevOps Learning

This folder contains my notes, scripts, and walkthroughs as I learn key DevOps skills from scratch. My goal is to become a fully capable DevOps engineer within the year.

## âœ… What I'm Covering

- Bash scripting (âœ… in progress)  
- Linux fundamentals (âœ… in progress)  
- Git and GitHub basics  
- Networking (DNS, ports, IP)  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Docker and containers  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
- Monitoring & logging tools (Grafana, Prometheus)  
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
