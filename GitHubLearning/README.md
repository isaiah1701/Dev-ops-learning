# 🔧 Git Learning Module

This module documents my hands-on learning and application of core Git workflows as part of my broader DevOps development journey.

---

## 📚 Building on Previous Work

I'm building on the Git knowledge I developed in my [QEA ZigWheels Project](https://github.com/isaiah1701/QeaZigWheelsProject), where I implemented a CI/CD pipeline and collaborated through Git-based version control.

That project introduced me to the fundamentals — cloning, staging, committing, and pushing — within a structured automation workflow.

## ✅ Core Git Concepts Covered

In this module, I’ve taken it further by practicing and applying:

- Feature branching to isolate development work
- Merging via pull requests
- Rebasing to maintain a clean, linear history
- Squash commits for tidier commit logs
- Conflict resolution during merges and rebases
- Force-pushing safely when necessary
- Reviewing and understanding Git history (`git log`, `git reflog`)

---

## 🧠 Practical Application

To apply these concepts in a meaningful way, I developed an interactive terminal game called [`bashBattle.sh`](https://github.com/isaiah1701/Dev-ops-learning/tree/main/BashScriptingModule/BashBattleArena).

The feature was developed using Git best practices:
- A separate branch was created for development
- Commits were squashed and rebased for a cleaner history
- A pull request was used to merge into the main module
- Git was used as a safety net while iterating and enhancing the script

This reinforced not just the commands, but **how to use Git like a professional** in real projects.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `README.md` – This file
- `.gitignore` – Git ignore rules
- Git experiment notes and test scripts (WIP)

---

## 🚀 What's Next

I’ll continue applying advanced Git workflows in upcoming modules (Docker, CI/CD, etc.), focusing on:
- Release tagging
- Git hooks
- Collaboration simulation
- Reverting and cherry-picking

Each practice is designed to make me confident using Git in both solo and team-based DevOps environments.
