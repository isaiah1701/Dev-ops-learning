## ?? Notes

- What did you learn?
Learned how to SSH into a remote server using a non-default port (-p 2220)

Used cat to read a file — simple but essential for working in the terminal

Noticed that the file was already in the home directory — no extra navigation required

Tricky part: none, just following instructions and not overthinking it
- Any new command/tool?
    cat and SSH 
- Anything tricky?
   No, none
